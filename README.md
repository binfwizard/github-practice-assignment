# Practicing version control in GitHub

My goal with this class is to learn how to use branches as well as how to merge different branches. I also hope to learn more about Git best practices and advanced commands such as git stash.

Reproducibility is important to me because when a bionformatics tool includes example data and detailed instructions, it helps me learn more about that field of study. It also helps me see areas of potential improvement in that tool.
